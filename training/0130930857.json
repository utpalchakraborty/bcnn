Because of the wide scope of the subject matter, the author has included review sections so that readers with little knowledge of biology, chemistry, geology, or hydraulics can comprehend and use this book, and mathematical topics are introduced at a relatively basic level. An overview of environmental technology introduces the book, and includes a discussion of public health, ecology, geology, and soils. The book then focuses on water and wastewater topics, including hydraulics and hydrology, water quality and water pollution, drinking water treatment and distribution, sewage collection, sewage treatment and disposal, and stormwater water management. Municipal solid waste, hazardous waste, air pollution, and noise pollution are also discussed. For individuals working in the fields of environmental quality control and public health protection, as well as civil engineers, wastewater technicians, and water treatment professionals.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2003", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=iO4JAQAAMAAJ&dq=isbn:0130930857&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Basic Environmental Technology", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 535, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0130930857", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780130930859", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iO4JAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iO4JAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Jerry A.
