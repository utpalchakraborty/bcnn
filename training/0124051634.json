Bio-inspired algorithms such as ant colony algorithms, bat algorithms, bee algorithms, firefly algorithms, cuckoo search and particle swarm optimization have been applied in almost every area of science and engineering with a dramatic increase of number of relevant publications. This book reviews the latest developments in swarm intelligence and bio-inspired computation from both the theory and application side, providing a complete resource that analyzes and discusses the latest and future trends in research directions. It can help new researchers to carry out timely research and inspire readers to develop new algorithms. With its impressive breadth and depth, this book will be useful for advanced undergraduate students, PhD students and lecturers in computer science, engineering and science as well as researchers and engineers. Focuses on the introduction and analysis of key algorithms Includes case studies for real-world applications Contains a balance of theory and applications, so readers who are interested in either algorithm or applications will all benefit from this timely book.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2013", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=nEDjmAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0124051634&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Swarm Intelligence and Bio-inspired Computation", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 422, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0124051634", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780124051638", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nEDjmAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nEDjmAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Xin-She Yang", "Zhihua Cui", "Renbin Xiao", "Amir Hossein Gandomi", "Mehmet Karamanoglu"], "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=nEDjmAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0124051634&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Computers"], "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Swarm_Intelligence_and_Bio_inspired_Comp.html?hl=&id=nEDjmAEACAAJ"}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This book reviews the latest developments in swarm intelligence and bio-inspired computation from both the theory and application side, providing a complete resource that analyzes and discusses the latest and future trends in research ..."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "pdO0Pc5QuJc", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=nEDjmAEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "US", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "nEDjmAEACAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/nEDjmAEACAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}
