The book concentrates on core concepts and principles and gives students an in-depth understanding of the central ideas of educational psychology. The text, more then any other text, moves seamlessly between theory and applications, and includes innumerable concrete examples--video cases, written cases, student artifacts, and more--to help students connect educational psychology to children and classrooms.
