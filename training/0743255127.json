{"totalItems": 1, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "volumeInfo": {"publisher": "Free Press", "description": "Acclaimed New York Times journalist and author Chris Hedges offers a critical -- and fascinating -- lesson in the dangerous realities of our age: a stark look at the effects of war on combatants. Utterly lacking in rhetoric or dogma, this manual relies instead on bare fact, frank description, and a spare question-and-answer format. Hedges allows U.S. military documentation of the brutalizing physical and psychological consequences of combat to speak for itself. Hedges poses dozens of questions that young soldiers might ask about combat, and then answers them by quoting from medical and psychological studies. \u2022 What are my chances of being wounded or killed if we go to war? \u2022 What does it feel like to get shot? \u2022 What do artillery shells do to you? \u2022 What is the most painful way to get wounded? \u2022 Will I be afraid? \u2022 What could happen to me in a nuclear attack? \u2022 What does it feel like to kill someone? \u2022 Can I withstand torture? \u2022 What are the long-term consequences of combat stress? \u2022 What will happen to my body after I die? This profound and devastating portrayal of the horrors to which we subject our armed forces stands as a ringing indictment of the glorification of war and the concealment of its barbarity.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2003-06-09", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=AGpYlQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0743255127&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "What Every Person Should Know About War", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/What_Every_Person_Should_Know_About_War.html?hl=&id=AGpYlQEACAAJ", "pageCount": 192, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0743255127", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780743255127", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AGpYlQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AGpYlQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Chris Hedges"], "ratingsCount": 23, "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=AGpYlQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0743255127&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["History"], "averageRating": 4.0}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Utterly lacking in rhetoric or dogma, this manual relies instead on bare fact, frank description, and a spare question-and-answer format."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "yG2jH6QM718", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=AGpYlQEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "US", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "AGpYlQEACAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/AGpYlQEACAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}
