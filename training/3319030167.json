The results described in the volume are expected to lead to more robust, dependable, and inexpensive distributed systems such as those endowed with complex and advanced sensing, actuation, computation, and communication capabilities. The twenty-four chapters discuss the field of robotic grasping and manipulation viewed in light of the human hand\u2019s capabilities and push the state-of-the-art in robot hand design and control. Topics discussed include human hand biomechanics, neural control, sensory feedback and perception, and robotic grasp and manipulation. This book will be useful for researchers from diverse areas such as robotics, biomechanics, neuroscience, and anthropologists.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2014-01-20", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=1OdNngEACAAJ&dq=isbn:3319030167&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "The Human Hand as an Inspiration for Robot Hand Development", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 572, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "3319030167", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9783319030166", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1OdNngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1OdNngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Ravi Balasubramanian", "Veronica J.
