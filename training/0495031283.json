In this briefer version, the authors explain abnormal psychology in the most modern, scientifically valid method for studying abnormal psychology. Through this integrative approach, students learn that psychological disorders are rooted in multiple factors: biological, psychological, cultural, social, familial, and even political. Conversational writing style, consistent pedagogy, video clips of real clients (located on the accompanying free Abnormal Psychology Live 2.5 CD-ROM), and real case profiles - 95 percent from the authors' own case files - provide a realistic context for the scientific findings of the book, and ensure that readers never lose sight of the fact that beyond the DSM-IV-TR criteria, the theories, and the research are real people. With this text, students can take advantage of Abnormal PsychologyNow, our web-based, intelligent study system that, by using online diagnostic pre- and post-tests, helps students prioritize their study time by creating personalized study plans that focus only the sections in which they experienced difficulty.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2005-07-01", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=pXBpngEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0495031283&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Essentials of Abnormal Psychology", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Essentials_of_Abnormal_Psychology.html?hl=&id=pXBpngEACAAJ", "pageCount": 736, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0495031283", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780495031284", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pXBpngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pXBpngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Vincent Mark Durand", "David H.
