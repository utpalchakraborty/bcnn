{"totalItems": 1, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "volumeInfo": {"publisher": "Thomson South-Western", "subtitle": "Foundations, Realities, and Challenges", "description": "Organizational Behavior provides the essential knowledge base and skill set so that future managers can harness the power of employees and teams to successfully navigate the changing world of work. Organizational behavior is the study of individual behavior and group dynamics in organizational settings. It focuses on timeless topics like motivation, leadership, teamwork, and communication. The text presents the opportunity to know concepts, ideas, and theories, and to practice skills, abilities, and behaviors to enhance the management of human behavior at work. To make the book more relevant to the learner, we have enhanced and further integrated the subtitle Foundations, Realities, Challenges into the theme in the 5th edition. The reader will see the tie to the subtitle with new feature titles: Foundations (new title: Science), Realities (new title: The Real World), and Challenges (new title: You) that have a more contemporary and personal feel. This theme will be integrated throughout the text and supplements making a true integrated learning package. In this new edition, six new focus companies have been selected. The authors use the focus companies so that learners can see how one company responds to different organizational situations. The focus companies are a variety of company types, for example, Whole Foods, Pixar, and Canine Companions. The authors also make sure to integrate four organizational behavior key themes into each chapter. These supporting themes are globalization, diversity, technology, and ethics. Sub-themes are designed to arm future managers with the tools they need to meet organizational challenges.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2006", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=3lLaKrHgJF0C&dq=isbn:0324224702&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Organizational Behavior", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Organizational_Behavior.html?hl=&id=3lLaKrHgJF0C", "pageCount": 636, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0324224702", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780324224702", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3lLaKrHgJF0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3lLaKrHgJF0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Debra L.
