The optical near fields are the elementary surface excitations on nanometric particles, i.e. dressed photons that carry material energy. Of the variety of qualitative innovations in optical technology realized by nanophotonics, this books focuses on fabrication. To fabricate nano-scale photonic devices with nanometer-scale controllability in size and position, we developed a self-assembly method for size- and position-controlled ultra-long nanodot chains using a novel effect of near-field optical desorption. A novel deposition and etching scheme under nonresonant conditions is also demonstrated and its origin is reviewed.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2012-04-13", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=KYWfXwAACAAJ&dq=isbn:3642241719&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Nanophotonic Fabrication", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 124, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "3642241719", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9783642241710", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KYWfXwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KYWfXwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Takashi Yatsui"], "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=KYWfXwAACAAJ&dq=isbn:3642241719&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Nanophotonic_Fabrication.html?hl=&id=KYWfXwAACAAJ"}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Of the variety of qualitative innovations in optical technology realized by nanophotonics, this books focuses on fabrication."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "d/bljaYz5Ko", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=KYWfXwAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "US", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "KYWfXwAACAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/KYWfXwAACAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}
