{"totalItems": 1, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "volumeInfo": {"publisher": "PediaPress GmbH", "description": "This is the thoroughly revised and updated second edition of the hugely successful The Art of Electronics. Widely accepted as the authoritative text and reference on electronic circuit design, both analog and digital, this book revolutionized the teaching of electronics by emphasizing the methods actually used by circuit designers -- a combination of some basic laws, rules of thumb, and a large bag of tricks. The result is a largely nonmathematical treatment that encourages circuit intuition, brainstorming, and simplified calculations of circuit values and performance. The new Art of Electronics retains the feeling of informality and easy access that helped make the first edition so successful and popular. It is an ideal first textbook on electronics for scientists and engineers and an indispensable reference for anyone, professional or amateur, who works with electronic circuits.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2011", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=yn2Uxzncsl8C&dq=isbn:0521370957&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "An introduction to electronics", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 1152, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/An_introduction_to_electronics.html?hl=&id=yn2Uxzncsl8C", "authors": ["The Wikipedians"], "ratingsCount": 17, "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=yn2Uxzncsl8C&dq=isbn:0521370957&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "averageRating": 4.0}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This is the thoroughly revised and updated second edition of the hugely successful The Art of Electronics."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "zjwNq8OlyUI", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=yn2Uxzncsl8C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "US", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "yn2Uxzncsl8C", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/yn2Uxzncsl8C"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}
