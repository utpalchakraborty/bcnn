Each chapter starts with a list of goals that allows students to see what is ahead. The chapter concludes with a repetition of that list with summary information added. General ChemistryNow is correlated to this list. New to this edition are dozens of \"Active Figures\" to help students visualize chemistry in action. These animated versions of text art help students master key concepts from the book. \"Active Figures\" can be used as demonstrations in the classroom and each figure is paired with a guided exploration and exercise to ensure students understand the concept being illustrated. In-text worked \"Examples\" follow a four-part structure: \"Problem\" statement, \"Strategy\" for approaching the problem, fully worked \"Solution,\" and, where appropriate, a \"Comment\" on the problem and solution. Through this approach, students learn how to approach a problem rather than merely learning to memorize problem types and memorized solution approaches. Exercises appear throughout the text so students can check their comprehension of the material. Answers are in an appendix. \"Problem-Solving Tips\" provide readers tips for determining how to approach and solve problems. \"Chemical Perspectives\" are essays that bring relevance and perspective to a study of chemistry. In order to put chemistry in its historical context, \"Historical Perspective\" essays describe the people who were key to developing the concepts of the chapter. \"A Closer Look\" essays describe ideas that form the background to material under discussion or provide another dimension of the subject. - Publisher.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2005-01-20", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=Bmre3DpkeY0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:053499766X&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api", "title": "Chemistry and Chemical Reactivity", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Chemistry_and_Chemical_Reactivity.html?hl=&id=Bmre3DpkeY0C", "pageCount": 1145, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.1", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "053499766X", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780534997663", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Bmre3DpkeY0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Bmre3DpkeY0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["John Kotz", "Paul Treichel", "Gabriela Weaver"], "ratingsCount": 1, "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=Bmre3DpkeY0C&dq=isbn:053499766X&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Science"], "averageRating": 3.0}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This revision includes General ChemistryNow, a new CD-ROM and web-based learning system that focuses on goals, connections, and complete integration with the text."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "UTp072bYjt8", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=Bmre3DpkeY0C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": true, "country": "US", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "PARTIAL", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE"}, "id": "Bmre3DpkeY0C", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Bmre3DpkeY0C"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}
