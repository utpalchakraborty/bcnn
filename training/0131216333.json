This book provides a clear and comprehensive introduction to the application of electronic control systems in mechanical and electrical engineering. It gives a framework of knowledge that allows engineers and technicians to develop an interdisciplinary understanding and integrated approach to engineering. Key features of the third edition provides the mix of skills in mechanical engineering, electronics and computing which are required for students to be able to comprehend and design mechatronics systems enables students to operate and communicate across a range of engineering disciplines more discussion of microcontrollers and programming increased use of models for mechatronics systems numerous examples and case studies end-of-chapter problems with answers at the back of the book Mechatronics is essential reading for students studying mechatronics at higher diploma and undergraduate level. Bill Bolton was formally Consultant to the Further Education Unit and Head of Research and Development and Monitoring at BTEC. He is the author of many engineering textbooks.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2003", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=veARahYArvwC&dq=isbn:0131216333&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Mechatronics", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Mechatronics.html?hl=&id=veARahYArvwC", "pageCount": 574, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "1.1.2.0.preview.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0131216333", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780131216334", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=veARahYArvwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=veARahYArvwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["William Bolton"], "ratingsCount": 5, "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=veARahYArvwC&dq=isbn:0131216333&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "averageRating": 4.5}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This book provides a clear and comprehensive introduction to the application of electronic control systems in mechanical and electrical engineering."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "VSmUSA1s3V4", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=veARahYArvwC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "US", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "veARahYArvwC", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/veARahYArvwC"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}
