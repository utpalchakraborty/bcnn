Cost topics are covered in the context of organizational strategy and operational tactics, as cost management decisions are sensitive to strategies driven by quality, cost, and innovation. Kinney, Prather-Kinsey, and Raiborn reinforce the material with real-world examples and visual illustrations that bring cost management techniques into the student's sphere of understanding. A flexible organization appropriate for either a one- or two- semester course--coupled with clear and abundant visual presentations--allows students to clearly understand difficult topics. The text's revised organizational structure streamlines chapter materials as well as reduces redundancy between cost accounting and other business courses.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2005-01", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=gK4x1v9viu4C&dq=isbn:0324235011&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Cost Accounting", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Cost_Accounting.html?hl=&id=gK4x1v9viu4C", "pageCount": 819, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0324235011", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780324235012", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gK4x1v9viu4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gK4x1v9viu4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Michael R.
