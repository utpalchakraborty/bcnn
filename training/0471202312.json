The authors show how to develop an orderly plan to solve problems: starting from basic equations, then clearly stating assumptions, and finally, relating results to expected physical behavior. This new edition simplifies many of the steps involved in analysis by using the computer application Excel. Over 100 detailed example problems illustrate important fluid mechanics concepts: Approximately 1300 end-of-chapter problems are arranged by difficulty level and include many problems that are designed to be solved using Excel. The CD for the book includes: A Brief Review of Microsoft Excel and numerous Excel files for the example problems and for use in solving problems. The new edition includes an expanded discussion of pipe networks, and a new section on oblique shocks and expansion waves.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2004", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=wroeAQAAIAAJ&dq=isbn:0471202312&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Introduction to fluid mechanics", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 787, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "1.1.0.0.preview.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "STANFORD:36105028432552", "type": "OTHER"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wroeAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wroeAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Robert W.
