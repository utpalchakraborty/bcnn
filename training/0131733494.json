Covers a full range of topics - number systems and codes, digital circuits, combinational logic design principles and practices, combinational logic design with PLDs, sequential logic design principles and practices, sequential logic design with PLDs, memory, and additional real-world topics (e.g., computer-aided engineering tools, design for testability, estimating digital system reliability, and transmission lines, reflections, and termination). This edition introduces PLDs as soon as possible, emphasizes CMOS logic families and introduces digital circuits in a strongly technology-independent fashion, covers the latest Generic Array Logic (GAL) devices, offers expanded coverage of ROM and RAM system-level design, and provides additional design examples. For those needing a solid introduction or review of the principles and practices of modern digital design.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2005-07", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=KPCyPwAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0131733494&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Digital Design", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Digital_Design.html?hl=&id=KPCyPwAACAAJ", "pageCount": 895, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0131733494", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780131733497", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KPCyPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KPCyPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["John F.
