Based on the author's teaching and research experience in the past ten years, the text follows three general principles: (1) Motivate the reader by describing the significance and application of each idea with real-world problems; (2) Force the reader to look at concepts from an intuitive point of view, preparing him/her for more complex problems; (3) Complement the intuition by rigorous analysis, confirming the results obtained by the intuitive, yet rough approach.", "language": "ja", "publishedDate": "2000-08-15", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=X_rAQgAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0072380322&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Design of Analog CMOS Integrated Circuits", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Design_of_Analog_CMOS_Integrated_Circuit.html?hl=&id=X_rAQgAACAAJ", "pageCount": 704, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0072380322", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780072380323", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=X_rAQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=X_rAQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Behzad Razavi"], "ratingsCount": 1, "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=X_rAQgAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0072380322&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "averageRating": 3.0}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Based on the author&#39;s teaching and research experience in the past ten years, the text follows three general principles: (1) Motivate the reader by describing the significance and application of each idea with real-world problems; (2) Force ..."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "UxIC+C5NbK8", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=X_rAQgAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "US", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "X_rAQgAACAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/X_rAQgAACAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}
