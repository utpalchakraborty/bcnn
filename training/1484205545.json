{"totalItems": 1, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "volumeInfo": {"publisher": "Apress", "subtitle": "A Practical Techniques Approach for Industry", "description": "Numerical Python by Robert Johansson shows you how to leverage the numerical and mathematical modules in Python and its Standard Library as well as popular open source numerical Python packages like NumPy, FiPy, Pillow, matplotlib and more to numerically compute solutions and mathematically model applications in a number of areas like big data, cloud computing, financial engineering, business management and more. After reading and using this book, you'll get some takeaway case study examples of applications that can be found in areas like business management, big data/cloud computing, financial engineering (i.e., options trading investment alternatives), and even games. Up until very recently, Python was mostly regarded as just a web scripting language. Well, computational scientists and engineers have recently discovered the flexibility and power of Python to do more. Big data analytics and cloud computing programmers are seeing Python's immense use. Financial engineers are also now employing Python in their work. Python seems to be evolving as a language that can even rival C++, Fortran, and Pascal/Delphi for numerical and mathematical computations. What you\u2019ll learn How to plot and graph with matplotlib How to construct vectors and matrices with NumPy How to solve linear/non-linear equations with NumPy How to solve equations with finite element methods using FiPy How to design UIs with wxPython and game UIs with PyGame How to handle image processing with Pillow, matplotlib and OpenCV How to do numerical computations, interpolations and optimizations using SciPy How to handle file I/O, data encoding/compression, and text/date/time processing Who this book is for This practical book is for those practicing industry coders, data scientists, engineers, financial engineers, scientists, business managers and more who use or plan to use numerical Python techniques and methods.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2015-11-11", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=BREbogEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1484205545&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Numerical Python", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 400, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "1484205545", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9781484205549", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BREbogEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BREbogEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Robert Johansson"], "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=BREbogEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1484205545&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Computers"], "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Numerical_Python.html?hl=&id=BREbogEACAAJ"}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "After reading and using this book, you&#39;ll get some takeaway case study examples of applications that can be found in areas like business management, big data/cloud computing, financial engineering (i.e., options trading investment ..."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "osy4jQXLQI8", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=BREbogEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "US", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "BREbogEACAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/BREbogEACAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}
