The authors have structured Management as a series of two-page spreads (i.e., left and right facing pages) of 2 - 6 pages per section, to optimize learning by presenting information in easily mastered \"bite-size\" chunks. Although the text is organized in a unique manner, the coverage of basic management concepts and principles is still prevalent. And besides presenting fundamental concepts of management, the book emphasizes practical advice throughout, expressed in the features \"The Manager's Toolbox,\" \"Practical Action\" boxes, real-life \"Example\" boxes, \"Management in Action\" and \"Ethical Dilemma\" cases, and the Web-based \"Taking Something Practical Away from this Chapter\".", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2005-01-01", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=gn9ikerPrL4C&dq=isbn:0073138967&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Management", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 576, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0073138967", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780073138961", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gn9ikerPrL4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gn9ikerPrL4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Angelo Kinicki", "Brian K.
