Beginning with research on how students think mathematically, contributors explain how to set strong foundations for beginning calculus by developing a rich conception of variables, rethinking change, building reasoning abilities and supporting the concept of accumulation. Contributors describe how students develop notions about infinity, limit and divisibility, covering the theory and design for the instruction of concepts, and describe the process of learning about proving theorems, starting with overcoming students' difficulties with proofs, and move to cross-cutting topics such as interacting with students, using definitions and examples as well as appropriate technology, and acquiring knowledge, assumptions and problem-solving behaviors in teaching. This works as a reader as well as a course text and a foundation for self-study.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2008-05-22", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=AOPuAAAAMAAJ&dq=isbn:0883851830&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Making the connection", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 319, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0883851830", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780883851838", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AOPuAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AOPuAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Marilyn Paula Carlson", "Chris Rasmussen"], "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=AOPuAAAAMAAJ&dq=isbn:0883851830&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Mathematics"], "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Making_the_connection.html?hl=&id=AOPuAAAAMAAJ"}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Directed toward instructors but also useful to administrators and curriculum specialists, this collection of 23 articles focuses on improving undergraduate courses at the introductory through advanced levels."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "vxsEK5nJYC4", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=AOPuAAAAMAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "US", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "AOPuAAAAMAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/AOPuAAAAMAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}
