Based on the most recent standards from ASHRAE, this Sixth Edition provides complete and up-to-date coverage of all aspects of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. You'll find the latest load calculation procedures, indoor air quality procedures, and issues related to ozone depletion. Throughout the text, numerous worked examples clearly show you how to apply the concepts in realistic scenarios. In addition, several computer programs (several new to this edition) help you understand key concepts and allow you to simulate various scenarios, such as psychometrics and air quality, load calculations, piping system design, duct system design, and cooling coil simulation. Additionally, the load calculation program has been revised and updated. These computer programs are available at the book's website: wiley.com/college/mcquiston Key Features of the Sixth EditionAdditional new worked examples in the text and on the accompanying software.Chapters 6-9 have been extensively revised for clarity and ease of use.Chapter 8, The Cooling Load, now includes two approaches: the heat balance method, as recommended by ASHRAE, and the simpler RTS method. Both approaches include computer applications to aid in calculations.Provides complete, authoritative treatment of all aspects of HVAC, based on current ASHRAE standards.Numerous worked examples and homework problems provide realistic scenarios to apply concepts.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2005", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=BnQeAQAAIAAJ&dq=isbn:0471470155&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Heating_ventilating_and_air_conditioning.html?hl=&id=BnQeAQAAIAAJ", "pageCount": 623, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "0.1.1.0.preview.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0471470155", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780471470151", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BnQeAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BnQeAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Faye C.
