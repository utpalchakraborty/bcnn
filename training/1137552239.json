Economists can tend to relegate theological reasoning to the realm of private spirituality, seeing it as having with little relevance for their analysis of markets and economic activity. Simultaneously, theologians often make lofty and idealised pronouncements about economics with very little understanding of the economic realities they critique. It is into this gap that this volume seeks to provide a uniquely collaborative example. This volume brings together a group of prominent Christian economists and theologians in a conversation which seeks to better understand how we might make use of the tools of economic and theological reasoning\u2013which are too often wielded as swords of blame and recrimination against one another\u2013into plowshares: tools which can be used jointly by Christian economists and theologians to cultivate more just and moral economies in the 21st century.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2015-09-10", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=8Zw6rgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1137552239&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Theology and Economics", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 288, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "1137552239", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9781137552235", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8Zw6rgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8Zw6rgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Jeremy Kidwell", "Sean Doherty"], "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=8Zw6rgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1137552239&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Theology_and_Economics.html?hl=&id=8Zw6rgEACAAJ"}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Theology and Economics seeks to fill the gap in understanding, respect, and communication between economists and theologians and set a uniquely collaborative example."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "dMa0TrQ1KlU", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=8Zw6rgEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "US", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "8Zw6rgEACAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/8Zw6rgEACAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}
