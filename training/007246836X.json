The prerequisite is one year of calculus. The text offers a balanced presentation of applications and theory. The authors take care to develop the theoretical foundations for the statistical methods presented at a level that is accessible to students with only a calculus background. They explore the practical implications of the formal results to problem-solving so students gain an understanding of the logic behind the techniques as well as practice in using them. The examples, exercises, and applications were chosen specifically for students in engineering and computer science and include opportunities for real data analysis.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2003", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=Dqg-AQAAIAAJ&dq=isbn:007246836X&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Introduction to probability and statistics", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 798, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "007246836X", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780072468366", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Dqg-AQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Dqg-AQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Janet Susan Milton", "Jesse C.
