Norton provides a solid conceptual foundation for the kinematics and dynamics of machinery, presented in the context of what a design engineer needs to work with. The new 3/e has revised and expanded chapter problem set--231 new problems have been added. 88 Project Assignments are also included to give readers an in-depth look at mechanism design and analysis procedures in a realistic format. Coverage of compliant mechanisms and MEMS has been added in Chapter 2; a section entitled \"Some Useful Mechanisms\" is now in Chapter 3; treatment of cams in Chapters 8 has been condensed and modernized. Information on transmissions and engine dynamics has been enhanced and expanded as well. The third edition comes with a bound-in Student Resources CD-ROM, with Norton's own student-version programs, an extensive group of Working Model simulations (by Sid Wang, North Carolina A&T University), additional Working Model examples, and the MSC Working Model 2-D program itself (demonstration version). A new Book Website includes additional instructor and student resources. Detailed solutions to all chapter problems and project assignments, are available to instructors on the website, under password protection.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2004-06", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=1Ju3oAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0073109444&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Reprint MP Design of Machinery", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 832, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0073109444", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780073109442", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1Ju3oAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1Ju3oAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Robert L.
