This collection covers several areas of applications and motivates new research directions. The theme across all chapters combines several domains of AI research, Computational Intelligence and Machine Intelligence including an introduction to the recent research and models. Each of the subsequent chapters reveals leading edge research and innovative solution that employ AI techniques with an applied perspective. The problems include classification of spatial images, early smoke detection in outdoor space from video images, emergent segmentation from image analysis, intensity modification in images, multi-agent modeling and analysis of stress. They all are novel pieces of work and demonstrate how AI research contributes to solutions for difficult real world problems that benefit the research community, industry and society.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2013-11-13", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=QJuFngEACAAJ&dq=isbn:3319016482&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Recent Advances in Knowledge-based Paradigms and Applications", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 205, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "3319016482", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9783319016481", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QJuFngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QJuFngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Jeffrey W.
