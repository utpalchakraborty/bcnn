Coverage includes system-level issues related to the design and implementation of a complete single-chip radio receiver and related to the design and implementation of a filter circuit as a part of a complete single-chip radio receiver. Presents a new filter design approach, emphasizing low-voltage circuit solutions that can be implemented in modern, ultra-deep-submicron CMOS technologies; Includes filter circuit implementations designed as a part of a single-chip radio receiver in modern 1.2V 0.13um and 65nm CMOS; Describes design and implementation of a continuous-time low-pass filter for a multicarrier WCDMA base-station; Emphasizes system-level considerations throughout.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2012-03-15", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=M-FXiEqeioYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:1461433657&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Continuous-Time Low-Pass Filters for Integrated Wideband Radio Receivers", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 189, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "9781461433651", "type": "ISBN_13"}, {"identifier": "1461433657", "type": "ISBN_10"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M-FXiEqeioYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M-FXiEqeioYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Ville Saari", "Jussi Ryyn\u00e4nen", "Saska Lindfors"], "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=M-FXiEqeioYC&dq=isbn:1461433657&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Continuous_Time_Low_Pass_Filters_for_Int.html?hl=&id=M-FXiEqeioYC"}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This book presents a new filter design approach and concentrates on the circuit techniques that can be utilized when designing continuous-time low-pass filters in modern ultra-deep-submicron CMOS technologies for integrated wideband radio ..."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "Owlxzhw5mDY", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=M-FXiEqeioYC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": true, "country": "US", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "PARTIAL", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE"}, "id": "M-FXiEqeioYC", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/M-FXiEqeioYC"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}
