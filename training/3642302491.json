Throughout the text the authors provide a balanced coverage of the thermodynamic and kinetic processes at the heart of electrochemical systems. The first half of the book outlines fundamental concepts appropriate to undergraduate students and the second half gives an in-depth account of electrochemical systems suitable for experienced scientists and course lecturers. Concepts are clearly explained and mathematical treatments are kept to a minimum or reported in appendices. This book features: - Questions and answers for self-assessment - Basic and advanced level numerical descriptions - Illustrated electrochemistry applications This book is accessible to both novice and experienced electrochemists and supports a deep understanding of the fundamental principles and laws of electrochemistry.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2012-05-25", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=-XvpugAACAAJ&dq=isbn:3642302491&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Electrochemistry", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 352, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "3642302491", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9783642302497", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-XvpugAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-XvpugAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Christine Lefrou", "Pierre Fabry", "Jean-Claude Poignet"], "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=-XvpugAACAAJ&dq=isbn:3642302491&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Science"], "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Electrochemistry.html?hl=&id=-XvpugAACAAJ"}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This book features: - Questions and answers for self-assessment - Basic and advanced level numerical descriptions - Illustrated electrochemistry applications This book is accessible to both novice and experienced electrochemists and ..."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "pyFER3/0UFU", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=-XvpugAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "US", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "-XvpugAACAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/-XvpugAACAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}
