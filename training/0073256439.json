Students are introduced to the sound, six-step problem solving methodology in chapter one, and are consistently made to apply and practice these steps in practice problems and homework problems throughout the text and online using the KCIDE for Circuits software.A balance of theory, worked examples and extended examples, practice problems, and real-world applications, combined with over 300 new homework problems for the third edition and robust media offerings, renders the third edition the most comprehensive and student-friendly approach to linear circuit analysis.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2005-11-30", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=JOgeAQAAIAAJ&dq=isbn:0073256439&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Fundamentals of Electric Circuits", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Fundamentals_of_Electric_Circuits.html?hl=&id=JOgeAQAAIAAJ", "pageCount": 901, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0073256439", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780073256436", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JOgeAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JOgeAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Charles K.
