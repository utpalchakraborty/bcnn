Human Biology remains user friendly; relevancy and pedagogy are among its strengths. In this edition, as in previous editions, each chapter presents the topic clearly and distinctly so that students will feel capable of achieving an adult level of understanding. Detailed, high-level scientific data and terminology are not included because Dr. Mader believes that true knowledge consists of working concepts rather than technical facility.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2005-06", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=6nqVAAAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0073101761&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Human Biology", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Human_Biology.html?hl=&id=6nqVAAAACAAJ", "pageCount": 541, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0073101761", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780073101767", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6nqVAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6nqVAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Sylvia S.
