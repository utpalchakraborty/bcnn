Focusing on models used to support public transport policy analysis, Freight Transport Modelling systematically introduces the latest freight transport modelling approaches and describes the main methods and techniques used to arrive at operational models. As freight transport has grown exponentially in recent decades, policymakers now need to include freight flows in quantitative evaluations of transport systems. Whereas early freight modelling practice was inspired by passenger transport models, by now it has developed its separate stream of methods and techniques inspired by disciplines such as economic geography and supply chain management. Besides summarizing the latest achievements in fundamental research, this book describes the state of practice and advises practitioners on how to cope with typical challenges such as limitations in data availability. Uniquely focused book exploring the key issues and logistics of freight transport modelling Highlights the latest approaches and describes the main methods and techniques used to arrive at operational models Summarizes fundamental research into freight transport modeling, as well as current practices and advice for practitioners facing day-to-day challenges", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2013-10-15", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=8ZUTnwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:0124104002&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Modelling Freight Transport", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 256, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0124104002", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780124104006", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8ZUTnwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8ZUTnwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Lorant A.
