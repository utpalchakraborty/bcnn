Palm's text is notable for having the strongest coverage of computational software and system simulation of any available book. MATLAB is introduced in Chapter 1, and every subsequent chapter has a standalone MATLAB Applications section. No previous experience with MATLAB is assumed; methods are carefully explained, and a detailed appendix outlines use of the program. SIMULINK is introduced in Chapter 5, and used in subsequent chapters to demonstrate the use of system simulation techniques. This textbook also makes a point of using real-world systems, such as vehicle suspension systems and motion control systems, to illustrate textbook content.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2004-06", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=H1hGAAAAYAAJ&dq=isbn:0073016039&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "System Dynamics", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 928, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0073016039", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780073016030", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=H1hGAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=H1hGAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["William J.
