The Big Picture is presented with a discussion of network-based applications and services such as the WWW, e-mail and home video entertainment. The essential functions in the operation of a network are discussed, and examples are given that motivate the notion of layering, and the OSI Reference model. Exposing students to the big picture should help them learn and apply the information more readily. Network performance is introduced as an integral part of network design and operation.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2004", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=24juQicyawkC&dq=isbn:007246352X&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Communication Networks", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Communication_Networks.html?hl=&id=24juQicyawkC", "pageCount": 900, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "007246352X", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780072463521", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=24juQicyawkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=24juQicyawkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Alberto Leon-Garcia", "Indra Widjaja"], "ratingsCount": 4, "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=24juQicyawkC&dq=isbn:007246352X&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Computers"], "averageRating": 4.5}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Thi work is designed for introductory one-semester or one-year courses in communications networks in upper-level undergraduate programmes."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "dsz03vas6tI", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=24juQicyawkC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "US", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "24juQicyawkC", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/24juQicyawkC"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}
