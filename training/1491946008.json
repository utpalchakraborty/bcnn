Python's simplicity quickly lets you become productive with it, but this often means you aren\u2019t using everything the language has to offer. By taking you through Python\u2019s key language features and libraries, this practical book shows you how to make your code shorter, faster, and more readable all at the same time\u2014what experts consider Pythonic. Many programmers who learn Python basics fall into the trap of reinventing the wheel because of past experience in other languages, and try to bend the language to patterns that don't really apply to it. Author Luciano Ramalho, a Python Software Foundation member and Python programmer for 15 years, helps you drop your accent from another language so you can code Python fluently. Learn practical applications of generators for database processing Rethink some design patterns in a Python context Examine attribute descriptors and when to use them: the key to ORMs Explore Pythonic objects: protocols versus interfaces, abstract base classes and multiple inheritance", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2015-06-25", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=kgrXoAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1491946008&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Fluent Python", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Fluent_Python.html?hl=&id=kgrXoAEACAAJ", "pageCount": 750, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "1491946008", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9781491946008", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kgrXoAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kgrXoAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Luciano Ramalho"], "ratingsCount": 2, "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=kgrXoAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1491946008&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Computers"], "averageRating": 4.5}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "By taking you through Python\u2019s key language features and libraries, this practical book shows you how to make your code shorter, faster, and more readable all at the same time\u2014what experts consider Pythonic."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "JrpvyT9sEBE", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=kgrXoAEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "US", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "kgrXoAEACAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/kgrXoAEACAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}
