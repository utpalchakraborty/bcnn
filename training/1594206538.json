Once hailed as \u201cSuper-K\u201d\u2014the \u201cindispensable man\u201d whose advice has been sought by every president from Kennedy to Obama\u2014he has also been hounded by conspiracy theorists, scouring his every \u201ctelcon\u201d for evidence of Machiavellian malfeasance. Yet as Niall Ferguson shows in this magisterial biography, the idea of Kissinger as the ruthless arch-realist is based on a profound misunderstanding. Drawing not only on Kissinger\u2019s hitherto closed private papers but also on documents from more than a hundred archives around the world, Ferguson argues that the true foundation of Kissinger\u2019s thought is philosophical idealism\u2014combined with history itself. The first half of Kissinger\u2019s life is usually skimmed over as a quintessential tale of American ascent: the Jewish refugee from Hitler\u2019s Germany who made it to the White House. But in this first of two volumes, Ferguson shows that what Kissinger achieved before his appointment as Richard Nixon\u2019s national security adviser was astonishing in its own right. Toiling as a teenager in a New York factory, he studied indefatigably at night. He was drafted into the U.S. infantry and saw action at the Battle of the Bulge\u2014as well as the liberation of a concentration camp\u2014but ended his army career interrogating Nazis. It was at Harvard that Kissinger found his vocation. Having immersed himself in the philosophy of Kant and the diplomacy of Metternich, he shot to celebrity by arguing for \u201climited nuclear war.\u201d Nelson Rockefeller hired him. Kennedy called him to Camelot. Yet Kissinger\u2019s rise was anything but irresistible. Dogged by press gaffes and disappointed by \u201cRocky,\u201d Kissinger seemed stuck\u2014until a trip to Vietnam changed everything. The Idealist is the story of the single most important strategic thinker America has ever produced. It is also a political Bildungsroman, explaining how \u201cDr. Strangelove\u201d ended up as consigliere to a politician he had always abhorred. Like Ferguson\u2019s classic two-volume history of the House of Rothschild, Kissinger sheds dazzling new light on an entire era. The essential account of an extraordinary life, it recasts the cold war world.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2015-09-29", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=_EgcrgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1594206538&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Kissinger: Volume I", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 656, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "1594206538", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9781594206535", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_EgcrgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_EgcrgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Niall Ferguson"], "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=_EgcrgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1594206538&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Biography & Autobiography"], "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Kissinger_Volume_I.html?hl=&id=_EgcrgEACAAJ"}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Yet as Niall Ferguson shows in this magisterial two-volume biography, drawing not only on Kissinger s hitherto closed private papers but also on documents from more than a hundred archives around the world, the idea of Kissinger as the ..."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "7P6w6xKF29Y", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=_EgcrgEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "US", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "_EgcrgEACAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/_EgcrgEACAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}
