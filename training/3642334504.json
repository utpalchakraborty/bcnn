It explains besides the formulation of design processes and its complete manufacturing input. This book gives an idea of mechanisms of friction and how to control them by designing .The book is useful for designers of automotive, rail and aero industries for designing the brake systems effectively with the integration of friction material composite design which is critical. It clearly emphasizes the driving safety and how serious designers should select the design input. The significance of friction material component like brake pad or a liner as an integral part of the brake system of vehicles is explained. AFM pictures at nanolevel illustrate broadly the explanations given.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2013-01-10", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=qLBtMAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:3642334504&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Friction Material Composites", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 333, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "3642334504", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9783642334504", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qLBtMAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qLBtMAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["K.
