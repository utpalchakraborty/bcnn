Like its predecessors, this revision is written from the viewpoint of the applied mathematician, focusing both on the theory and the practical applications of Differential Equations as they apply to engineering and the sciences. Sound and accurate exposition of theory with special attention is made to methods of solution, analysis, and approximation. Use of technology, illustrations, and problem sets help readers develop an intuitive understanding of the material. Historical footnotes trace development of the discipline and identify outstanding individual contributions.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2005", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=pjJeQgAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0471433381&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Elementary_Differential_Equations_and_Bo.html?hl=&id=pjJeQgAACAAJ", "pageCount": 790, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0471433381", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780471433385", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pjJeQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pjJeQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["William E.
