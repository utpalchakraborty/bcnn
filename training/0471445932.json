A unified thread exercised throughout are the roles of statistics and uncertainty analysis in developing test plans, selecting systems, anticipating the quality of results and in reporting results. This text features a thorough discussion of sampling concepts and data acquisition system and signal conditioning methods. The book provides a well-founded background in the theory of engineering measurements. Integrated throughout are the necessary elements for the design of measurement systems and measurement test plans, including the integrated role of statistics and uncertainty analyses in design and analyses.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2006", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=qmdRAAAAMAAJ&dq=isbn:0471445932&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Theory and design for mechanical measurements", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Theory_and_design_for_mechanical_measure.html?hl=&id=qmdRAAAAMAAJ", "pageCount": 542, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "0.1.1.0.preview.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0471445932", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780471445937", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qmdRAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qmdRAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["R.
