{"totalItems": 1, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "volumeInfo": {"publisher": "Addison-Wesley", "description": "At a time when so many pivotal economic issues are closely tied to the business cycle and monetary-fiscal policy, Robert Gordon provides critical insight into the American and global economy. Macroeconomics builds from an early emphasis on business cycles and monetary-fiscal policy, in both the closed and open economy, to a dynamic analysis of aggregate demand and supply shocks as the causes of inflation and unemployment. Gordon then discusses economic growth using theory and real-world examples to compare rich and poor countries before examining economic growth in the United States. In the Tenth Edition, Gordon tightens the overall framework of chapters, introduces four-color pedagogy, and prepares students to join in discussion and debate about the latest issues including the jobless recovery, recent tax cuts, globalization, and the explosion of U.S. productivity growth.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2006", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=Jl0nAQAAMAAJ&dq=isbn:0321278801&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Macroeconomics", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Macroeconomics.html?hl=&id=Jl0nAQAAMAAJ", "pageCount": 599, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "0.1.0.0.preview.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "NWU:35556019845643", "type": "OTHER"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Jl0nAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Jl0nAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Robert James Gordon"], "ratingsCount": 1, "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=Jl0nAQAAMAAJ&dq=isbn:0321278801&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "averageRating": 2.0}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "In the Tenth Edition, Gordon tightens the overall framework of chapters, introduces four-color pedagogy, and prepares students to join in discussion and debate about the latest issues including the jobless recovery, recent tax cuts, ..."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "5nyi3ZPqoDU", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=Jl0nAQAAMAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "US", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "Jl0nAQAAMAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Jl0nAQAAMAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}
