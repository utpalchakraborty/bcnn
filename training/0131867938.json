It demonstrates how and when to use statistical methods, while reinforcing the calculus that readers have already mastered. Presents standard statistical techniques in a mathematical context, allowing the reader to see the underlying hypotheses for the applications. Uses case studies and practical worked-out examples to motivate statistical reasoning and demonstrate the application of statistical methods to a wide variety of real-world situations. Discusses practical problems in the application of the ideas covered in each chapter, as well as common misunderstandings or faulty approaches. Revised Minitab sections now conform to the Version 14, the latest release. For anyone interested in learning more about mathematical statistics.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2006", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=4CIYHAAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0131867938&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "An Introduction to Mathematical Statistics and Its Applications", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/An_Introduction_to_Mathematical_Statisti.html?hl=&id=4CIYHAAACAAJ", "pageCount": 920, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0131867938", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780131867932", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4CIYHAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4CIYHAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Richard J.
