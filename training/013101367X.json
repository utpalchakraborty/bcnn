{"totalItems": 1, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "volumeInfo": {"publisher": "Prentice Hall", "subtitle": "Includes Unit Operations", "description": "Appropriate for one-year transport phenomena (also called transport processes) and separation processes course. First semester covers fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer; second semester covers separation process principles (includes unit operations). The title of this Fourth Edition has been changed from Transport Processes and Unit Operations to Transport Processes and Separation Process Principles (Includes Unit Operations). This was done because the term Unit Operations has been largely superseded by the term Separation Processes which better reflects the present modern nomenclature being used. The main objectives and the format of the Fourth Edition remain the same. The sections on momentum transfer have been greatly expanded, especially in the sections on fluidized beds, flow meters, mixing, and non-Newtonian fluids. Material has been added to the chapter on mass transfer. The chapters on absorption, distillation, and liquid-liquid extraction have also been enlarged. More new material has been added to the sections on ion exchange and crystallization. The chapter on membrane separation processes has been greatly expanded especially for gas-membrane theory.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2003", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=i9-TQgAACAAJ&dq=isbn:013101367X&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Transport Processes and Separation Process Principles", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Transport_Processes_and_Separation_Proce.html?hl=&id=i9-TQgAACAAJ", "pageCount": 1026, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "013101367X", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780131013674", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=i9-TQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=i9-TQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Christie J.
