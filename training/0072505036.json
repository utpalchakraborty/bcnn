The new edition has been revised to make the material more motivating and accessible to students. A new co-author, Travis Blalock, has joined the author team to assist in providing a student-friendly approach. A pedagogical framework has been added that includes chapter opening vignettes, chapter objectives, \"Electronics in Action\" boxes, a problem solving methodology, and \"design note\" boxes.
