{"totalItems": 1, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "volumeInfo": {"publisher": "Thomson West", "description": "This popular text effectively combines a traditional case focus with clear and concise coverage of a wide range of up-to-date topics. Since most students will become businesspersons, the material is presented from the perspective of the professional non-lawyer. This book offers the opportunity to learn key points of the law from the standpoint of a working professional. Unlike other books it does not get bogged down in the complexities of the law, but tries to focus, in a very straightforward manner, on the core legal concepts that will be most essential for the business manager to know. Rather than conveying the material in the serious tone of many other legal environment books, the easy readability of this text, interjected with points of humor and levity, make it much easier for the key ideas to come across.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2005-03-01", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=8ZvaVXT1n3IC&dq=isbn:032420485X&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "The Legal Environment of Business", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Legal_Environment_of_Business.html?hl=&id=8ZvaVXT1n3IC", "pageCount": 736, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "032420485X", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780324204858", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8ZvaVXT1n3IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8ZvaVXT1n3IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Roger E.
