Topics are organized and explained in an approachable manner, so that even instructors who do not have a strong materials background can teach from this user-friendly text. The text treats the important properties of the three primary types of materials (metals, ceramics, and polymers) and composites, as well as the relationships that exist between the structural elements of materials and their properties. Throughout, the emphasis is on mechanical behavior and failure, including techniques that are employed to improve performance. Individual chapters discuss corrosion, electrical, thermal, magnetic, and optical properties, as well as new and cutting-edge materials.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2007", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=cEmvx57kWRIC&dq=isbn:0471736961&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Materials Science And Engineering", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Materials_Science_And_Engineering.html?hl=&id=cEmvx57kWRIC", "pageCount": 721, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "0.1.1.0.preview.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "MINN:31951D02687467A", "type": "OTHER"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cEmvx57kWRIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cEmvx57kWRIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["William D.
