As both the number and types of students are increasing, it is essential to have a textbook that provides coverage of the latest advances, while presenting the material in a way that is accessible to students with little or no background in the field. Using a bottom-up approach, Data Communications and Networking presents this highly technical subject matter without relying on complex formulas by using a strong pedagogical approach supported by more than 700 figures. Now in its Fourth Edition, this textbook brings the beginning student right to the forefront of the latest advances in the field, while presenting the fundamentals in a clear, straightforward manner. Students will find better coverage, improved figures and better explanations on cutting-edge material. The \"bottom-up\" approach allows instructors to cover the material in one course, rather than having separate courses on data communications and networking.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2006-02-09", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=xgo5qAAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0073250325&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Data Communications Networking", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Data_Communications_Networking.html?hl=&id=xgo5qAAACAAJ", "pageCount": 1168, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0073250325", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780073250328", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xgo5qAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xgo5qAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Behrouz Forouzan"], "ratingsCount": 1, "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=xgo5qAAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0073250325&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Technology"], "averageRating": 5.0}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "As one of the fastest growing technologies in our culture today, data communications and networking presents a unique challenge for instructors."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "ZUSERdM+zZ8", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=xgo5qAAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "US", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "xgo5qAAACAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/xgo5qAAACAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}
