Information on cost estimation, depreciation, and taxes has been updated to conform to new tax laws and a majority of the end-of-chapter problems are revised or new to this edition. Distinguishing pedagogical characteristics of this market-leading text include its easy-to-read writing style, chapter objectives, worked examples, integrated spreadsheets, case studies, Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam questions, and numerous end-of-chapter problems. Graphical cross-referencing is indicated so users are able to locate additional material on any one subject in the text. While the chapters are progressive, over three-quarters can stand alone, allowing instructors flexibility for meeting course needs.
