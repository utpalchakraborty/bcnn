It is designed for a first course on electronic materials given in Materials Science and Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Physics and Engineering Physics Departments at the undergraduate level. The third edition has numerous revisions that include more beautiful illustrations and photographs, additional sections, more solved problems, worked examples, and end-of-chapter problems with direct engineering applications. The revisions have improved the rigor without sacrificing the original semiquantitative approach that both the students and instructors liked and valued. Some of the new end-of-chapter problems have been especially selected to satisfy various professional engineering design requirements for accreditation across international borders. Advanced topics have been collected under Additional Topics, which are not necessary in a short introductory treatment.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2005-03-25", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=3_dCuAAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0073104647&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Principles of Electronic Materials and Devices", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Principles_of_Electronic_Materials_and_D.html?hl=&id=3_dCuAAACAAJ", "pageCount": 768, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0073104647", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780073104645", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3_dCuAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3_dCuAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Safa Kasap"], "ratingsCount": 2, "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=3_dCuAAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0073104647&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "averageRating": 4.0}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Principles of Electronic Materials and Devices, Third Edition, is a greatly enhanced version of the highly successful text Principles of Electronic Materials and Devices, Second Edition."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "MVMvNDm8QUQ", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=3_dCuAAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "US", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "3_dCuAAACAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/3_dCuAAACAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}
