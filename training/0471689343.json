Bryan Derrickson of Valencia Community College in Orlando, Florida joins Jerry Tortora as a co-author, bringing his background and expertise in physiology in balance with Jerry's focus on anatomy. The authors have maintained in the text the superb balance between structure and function and continue to emphasize the correlations between normal physiology and pathophysiology, normal anatomy and pathology, and homeostasis and homeostatic imbalances. The acclaimed illustration program is now even better thanks to the input of hundreds of professors and students and the re-development of many of the figures depicting the toughest topics for students to grasp. The eleventh edition now fully integrates this exceptional text with a host of innovative electronic media, setting the standard once again for a rewarding and successful classroom experience for both students and instructors.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2005-04-26", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=brGEbJ-KiRIC&dq=isbn:0471689343&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Principles of Anatomy and Physiology, Atlas and Registration Card", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Principles_of_Anatomy_and_Physiology_Atl.html?hl=&id=brGEbJ-KiRIC", "pageCount": 1264, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "0.2.1.0.preview.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0471689343", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780471689348", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=brGEbJ-KiRIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=brGEbJ-KiRIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Gerard J.
