{"totalItems": 1, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "volumeInfo": {"description": "This comprehensive treatment of the analysis and design of continuous-time control systems provides a \"gradual\" development of control theory--and shows how to solve \"all\" computational problems with MATLAB. It avoids highly mathematical arguments, and features an abundance of examples and worked problems throughout the book. Chapter topics include the Laplace transform; mathematical modeling of mechanical systems, electrical systems, fluid systems, and thermal systems; transient and steady-state-response analyses, root-locus analysis and control systems design by the root-locus method; frequency-response analysis and control systems design by the frequency-response; two-degrees-of-freedom control; state space analysis of control systems and design of control systems in state space.
