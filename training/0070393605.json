Throughout this book the importance of management skills is emphasized to enable the user to develop his or her own style of project management. The focus is to apply project management at the beginning of a project, when it is first approved. Too often the formal organization to manage a project is not developed until the beginning of the construction phase. This book presents the information that must be assembled and managed during the development and engineering design phase to bring a project to successful completion by the owner.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2000-01-25", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=yZNRAAAAMAAJ&dq=isbn:0070393605&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Project Management for Engineers and Construction", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 384, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "0.1.1.0.preview.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0070393605", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780070393608", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yZNRAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yZNRAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Garold Oberlender"], "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=yZNRAAAAMAAJ&dq=isbn:0070393605&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Project_Management_for_Engineers_and_Con.html?hl=&id=yZNRAAAAMAAJ"}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The purpose of this book is to present the principles and techniques of project management, beginning with the conceptual phase by the owner, through coordination of design and construction, to project completion."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "svSd117KtR4", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=yZNRAAAAMAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "US", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "yZNRAAAAMAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/yZNRAAAAMAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}
