More specifically, Part I of the book focuses on the Sun, the properties of the ejected plasma, of the solar wind and on space weather. The second part deals with tides in planetary systems and in binary stellar systems, as well as with interactions in massive binary stars as seen by interferometry. Finally the chapters of Part III discuss the environments of young or evolved stars, stellar winds, agnetic fields and disks. With its broad approach the book will provide advanced students as well as researchers with a good overview of the environments of the Sun and the stars.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2012-08-17", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=AWV_rgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:3642306470&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "The Environments of the Sun and the Stars", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 253, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "3642306470", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9783642306471", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AWV_rgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AWV_rgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Jean-Pierre Rozelot", "Coralie Neiner"], "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=AWV_rgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:3642306470&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Science"], "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Environments_of_the_Sun_and_the_Star.html?hl=&id=AWV_rgEACAAJ"}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Based on lectures given at a CNRS summer school in France, this book covers many aspects of stellar environments (both observational and theoretical) and offers a broad overview of the field."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "IRtgsVASbL4", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=AWV_rgEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "US", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "AWV_rgEACAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/AWV_rgEACAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}
