Fitoussi's pluralistic approach has shaped modern macroeconomics, political economy, economics of inequality and, more recently, the economics of sustainability. This volume is both a tribute to and study of the French economist Jean-Paul Fitoussi. The text is edited by two of Fitoussi's closest collaborators over the years and includes contributions from five Nobel Prize winners, all also Fitoussi's co-authors and friends: Kenneth Arrow, Edmund Phelps, Amartya Sen, Robert Solow and Joseph Stiglitz. The volume editors provide a comprehensive introduction which contextualises Fitoussi's work and discusses his interpretations of Keynesian economics and the financial crises, as well as a broad outline of his ideas. The contributors closely examine Fitoussi's macroeconomic theory on managing economic policy, his ideas on Europe's integration, sustainability and measurement of the economic world. The format of the volume is original, since it allows Fitoussi to respond to three of the five Nobel prize winners, and is unique in providing a wide scope of opinions from top authorities in the field. This collection is a key study of Fitoussi's ideas making it essential reading for students and researchers of macroeconomic policy, European political economy and sustainability, as well as being of importance to policy-makers, civil-servants and the interested lay person.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2014-12-18", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=JeypoAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1137451041&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Fruitful Economics", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 96, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "1137451041", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9781137451040", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JeypoAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JeypoAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Eloi Laurent", "Jacques Le Cacheux"], "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=JeypoAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1137451041&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Fruitful_Economics.html?hl=&id=JeypoAEACAAJ"}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This collection is a key study of Fitoussi&#39;s ideas making it essential reading for students and researchers of macroeconomic policy, European political economy and sustainability, as well as being of importance to policy-makers, civil ..."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "ONE/1hcXr0I", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=JeypoAEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "US", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "JeypoAEACAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/JeypoAEACAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}
