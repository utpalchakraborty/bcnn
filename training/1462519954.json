Preeminent researcher Dan P. McAdams traces the development of three distinct layers of personality--the social actor who expresses emotional and behavioral traits, the motivated agent who pursues goals and values, and the autobiographical author who constructs a personal story for life. Highly readable and accessible to scholars and students at all levels, the book uses rich portraits of the lives of famous people to illustrate theoretical concepts and empirical findings\"--", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2015-02-19", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=JM58BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:1462519954&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "The Art and Science of Personality Development", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 368, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "1.1.0.0.preview.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "9781462519958", "type": "ISBN_13"}, {"identifier": "1462519954", "type": "ISBN_10"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JM58BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JM58BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Dan P.
