Metalinguistic negation and neg-raising are also explored in the volume. Leading specialists in the field present novel ideas by employing various experimental methods in felicity judgments, eye tracking, self-paced readings, prosody and ERP. Particular attention is given to extensive crosslinguistc data from French, Catalan and Korean along with analyses using semantic and pragmatic methods, corpus linguistics, diachronic perspectives and longitudinal acquisitional studies as well as signed and gestural negation. Each contribution is situated with regards to major previous studies, thereby offering readers insights on the current state of the art in research on negation and negative polarity, highlighting how theory and data together contributes to the understanding of cognition and mind.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2015-08-14", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=6FjzrQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:3319174630&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Negation and Polarity: Experimental Perspectives", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 376, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "3319174630", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9783319174631", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6FjzrQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6FjzrQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Pierre Larriv\u00e9e", "Chungmin Lee"], "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=6FjzrQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:3319174630&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Language Arts & Disciplines"], "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Negation_and_Polarity_Experimental_Persp.html?hl=&id=6FjzrQEACAAJ"}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This volume offers insights on experimental and empirical research in theoretical linguistic issues of negation and polarity, focusing on how negation is marked and how negative polarity is emphatic and how it interacts with double negation ..."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "NvY9X9DF/I8", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=6FjzrQEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "US", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "6FjzrQEACAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/6FjzrQEACAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}
