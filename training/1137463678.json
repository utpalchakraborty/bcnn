Convening perspectives from seven countries, the contributors are renowned scholars on both sides of the Pacific. In the light of current events, it recognizes that the dispute has the potential to destabilize East and Southeast Asia and even the entire Asia-Pacific if it is left unattended. The collection seeks to disentangle the historical, legal and political aspects of the dispute to facilitate a more practical and nuanced understanding of its complexities with individual chapters examining opportunities to find a way forward, while also taking into account the difference in viewpoint. Editors Huang Jing and Andrew Billo, both experts in the politics of the region, tie these pieces together through a comprehensive and succinct Iintroduction and conclusion respectively, arguing that the focus should be on effective management of the dispute to prevent dangerous and potentially destabilizing incidents at sea.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2014-12-02", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=Ywj5oAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1137463678&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Territorial Disputes in the South China Sea", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 232, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "1137463678", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9781137463678", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ywj5oAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ywj5oAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Jing Huang", "Andrew Billo"], "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=Ywj5oAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1137463678&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Political Science"], "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Territorial_Disputes_in_the_South_China.html?hl=&id=Ywj5oAEACAAJ"}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This volume provides in-depth analysis of the complexities of on-going territorial dispute in the South China Sea region through a multitude of perspectives of the involved stakeholders."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "8Jw8ldviA+k", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=Ywj5oAEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "US", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "Ywj5oAEACAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Ywj5oAEACAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}
