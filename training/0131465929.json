This edition was developed with keen attention to the learning needs of students. It includes illustrations that have been redesigned for clarity, new problems and new worked examples. Margin notes in the text point out the option of integrating PSpice with the provided Introduction to PSpice; and an instructor's roadmap (for instructors only) serves to classify homework problems by approach. The author has also given greater attention to the importance of circuit memory in electrical engineering, and to the role of electronics in the electrical engineering curriculum.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2005", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=twtzQgAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0131465929&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Electric Circuits", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 966, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0131465929", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780131465923", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=twtzQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=twtzQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["James William Nilsson", "Susan A.
