The first main part is concerned with graphene for energy storage applications such as lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors and hydrogen storage. The second part covers graphene-based energy-generation devices, in particular conventional as well as microbial and enzymatic fuel cells. Concluding chapters on graphene photovoltaics round off the book. In all chapters not only the device architectures on a laboratory scale will be discussed, but also ways for upscaling to an industrial level, including manufacturing processes and quality control.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2015-05-26", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=yV23BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:3527338063&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Graphene-based Energy Devices", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 464, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "0.2.0.0.preview.1", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "9783527338061", "type": "ISBN_13"}, {"identifier": "3527338063", "type": "ISBN_10"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yV23BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yV23BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["A.
