An accompanying CD provides supplementary software developed specifically for learning purposes -- e.g., SETTRATE. Discusses site exploration and characterization; soil composition; soil classification; excavation, grading, and compacted fill; groundwater -- fundamentals and applications; stress; compressibility and settlement; rate of consolidation; strength; stability of earth slope; dams and levees; lateral earth pressures and retaining walls; structural foundations; difficult soils; soil improvement; and geotechnical earthquake engineering. Makes extensive use of photographs and example problems. For geotechnical engineers, soils engineers, ground engineers, structural engineers, and civil engineers.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "1999", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=ifUeAQAAIAAJ&dq=isbn:0135763800&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Geotechnical Engineering", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 759, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0135763800", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780135763803", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ifUeAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ifUeAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Donald P.
