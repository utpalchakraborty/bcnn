{"totalItems": 1, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "volumeInfo": {"publisher": "Cengage Learning", "description": "Newman and Newman take a chronological approach to the study of the life span, drawing on the psychosocial theory of Erik Erikson to provide a conceptual framework for the text. Newman and Newman address physical, intellectual, social, and emotional growth in all life stages, focusing on the idea that development results from the interdependence of these areas at every stage, and placing special emphasis on optimal development through life. The text is noted for its clear organization, providing instructors and students with a coherent structure for tracing development over the life span. The text integrates theory and research with application, making the rich material of development useful for emerging professionals. Each life stage chapter ends with an applied topic that helps students connect the developmental themes of that stage with critical societal issues. The use of case material throughout offers a way to balance information about general patterns of development with information about individual differences and life stories. Human diversity is introduced in the very first chapter and is a continuing theme, reflected in research coverage, theoretical analysis, illustrations, and boxes. Through a variety of pedagogical strategies including the illustrations and captions, points for further reflection, and case analysis, the Newmans have created a text that encourages the reader to engage in ongoing integration and critical analysis.
