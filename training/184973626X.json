In order to design new self healing polymers it's important to understand the fundamental healing mechanisms behind the material. Healable Polymer Systems will outline the key concepts and mechanisms underpinning the design and processing of healable polymers, and indicate potential directions for progress in the future development and applications of these fascinating and potentially valuable materials. The book covers the different techniques developed successfully to date for both autonomous healable materials (those which do not require an external stimulus to promote healing) and rehealable or remendable materials (those which only recover their original physical properties if a specific stimulus is applied). These include the encapsulated-monomer approach, reversible covalent bond formation, irreversible covalent bond formation and supramolecular self-assembly providing detailed insights into their chemistry. Written by leading experts, the book provides polymer scientists with a compact and readily accessible source of reference for healable polymer systems.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2013", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=74ZKRzgY9OMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:184973626X&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Healable Polymer Systems", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 156, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "9781849736268", "type": "ISBN_13"}, {"identifier": "184973626X", "type": "ISBN_10"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=74ZKRzgY9OMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=74ZKRzgY9OMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Wayne Hayes", "Barnaby W.
