Comparatively overlooked has been the fact that the same factors that drove the US to war in 1898 - industrial growth, commercial expansion, and increased public interest in the wider world - had already powerfully influenced foreign policy in the years before the outbreak of war. As Nick Cleaver shows in this illuminating political and diplomatic history, McKinley's predecessor in the White House, Grover Cleveland, spent four years pursuing a different approach to foreign policy that acknowledged the changes taking place in American society at the end of the nineteenth century, even as it sought to harness them in very different ways.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2014-10-23", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=Y-_KoAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1137448474&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Grover Cleveland's New Foreign Policy", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 268, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "1137448474", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9781137448477", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Y-_KoAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Y-_KoAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Nick Cleaver"], "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=Y-_KoAEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1137448474&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["History"], "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Grover_Cleveland_s_New_Foreign_Policy.html?hl=&id=Y-_KoAEACAAJ"}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "As Nick Cleaver shows in this illuminating political and diplomatic history, McKinley&#39;s predecessor in the White House, Grover Cleveland, spent four years pursuing a different approach to foreign policy that acknowledged the changes taking ..."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "PfftTsLqzqs", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=Y-_KoAEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "US", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "Y-_KoAEACAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Y-_KoAEACAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}
