The book emphasises physical appreciation of concepts through heuristic reasoning, metaphors, analogies, and creative explanations. Such an approach is different from a purely deductive technique that uses mere mathematical manipulation of symbols and ignores the physical meaning behind various derivations, which deprives a student of the enjoyable experience of logically uncovering the subject matter. Here the author uses mathematics not so much to prove axio-matic theory as to support and enhance physical and intuitive understanding. Wherever possible, theoretical results are interpreted heuristically and are enhanced by carefully chosen examples and analogies. The organization of the text allows for a great deal of flexibility in teaching continuous-time and discrete-time concepts. The natural order of the chapters in the book integrates the two; however, the book can also be tailored to teach these concepts sequentially. Its thorough content, practical approach, and structural adaptability make Linear Systems and Signals 2e, ideal for undergraduate courses in linear systems or signals and systems. Covers new topics such as: Fourier applications to communication systems Bode plots Bandpass systems Convergence of an infinite series Group and phase delay Impulse invariance method of designing analog systems using digital filters Offers MATLAB focus sessions at the end of each chapter Includes more than 200 worked examples and end-of-chapter problems Provides updated and revised illustrations throughout Presents historical background notes to stimulate interest in the field", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2005", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=7resQgAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0195158334&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Linear Systems and Signals", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Linear_Systems_and_Signals.html?hl=&id=7resQgAACAAJ", "pageCount": 975, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0195158334", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780195158335", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7resQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7resQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Bhagwandas Pannalal Lathi"], "ratingsCount": 4, "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=7resQgAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0195158334&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Computers"], "averageRating": 3.5}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Similar to its predecessor, this edition presents a clear, comprehensive introduction to signals and linear systems."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "e5eWokw1ljg", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=7resQgAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "US", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "7resQgAACAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/7resQgAACAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}
