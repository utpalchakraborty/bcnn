The book also surveys various soft computing tools, fuzzy relational calculus (FRC), genetic algorithm (GA) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) to provide a strong foundation for the reader. The supervised approach to pattern classification and model-based approach to occluded object recognition are treated in one framework , one based on either a conventional interpretation or a new interpretation of multidimensional fuzzy implication (MFI) and a novel notion of fuzzy pattern vector (FPV). By combining practice and theory, a completely independent design methodology was developed in conjunction with this supervised approach on a unified framework, and then tested thoroughly against both synthetic and real-life data. In the field of soft computing, such an application-oriented design study is unique in nature. The monograph essentially mimics the cognitive process of human decision making, and carries a message of perceptual integrity in representational diversity. Soft Computing Approach to Pattern Classification and Object Recognition is intended for researchers in the area of pattern classification and computer vision. Other academics and practitioners will also find the book valuable.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2012-10-06", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=Tpw5pzOSNP8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:146145347X&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Soft Computing Approach to Pattern Classification and Object Recognition", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 176, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "9781461453475", "type": "ISBN_13"}, {"identifier": "146145347X", "type": "ISBN_10"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Tpw5pzOSNP8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Tpw5pzOSNP8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Kumar S.
