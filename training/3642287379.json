It begins with an overview of current theories, computational methods, experimental techniques, and applications of optics of small particles. There is also some biographic information on Gustav Mie, who published his famous paper on the colour of Gold colloids in 1908. The Mie solution for the light scattering of small spherical particles set the basis for more advanced scattering theories and today there are many methods to calculate light scattering and absorption for practically any shape and composition of particles. The optics of small particles is of interest in industrial, atmospheric, astronomic and other research. The book covers the latest developments in divers fields in scattering theory such as plasmon resonance, multiple scattering and optical force.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2012-07-01", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=ooOItgAACAAJ&dq=isbn:3642287379&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "The Mie Theory", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 259, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "3642287379", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9783642287374", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ooOItgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ooOItgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Wolfram Hergert", "Thomas Wriedt"], "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=ooOItgAACAAJ&dq=isbn:3642287379&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Science"], "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Mie_Theory.html?hl=&id=ooOItgAACAAJ"}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "The book covers the latest developments in divers fields in scattering theory such as plasmon resonance, multiple scattering and optical force.
