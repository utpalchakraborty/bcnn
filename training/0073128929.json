Kreitner and Kinicki\u2019s approach to organizational behavior is based on the authors\u2019 belief that reading a comprehensive textbook is hard work, but that the process should be interesting (and sometimes fun). Thus, they consistently attempt to find a way to make complex ideas understandable through explanations, contemporary examples, and/or learning exercises. With every edition, the authors make every effort to respond to user feedback and ensure the text covers the very latest OB research and practices. The seventh edition of Organizational Behavior again uses the familiar wolf image on its cover. This remains a central theme because Kreitner and Kinicki see wolves as an instructive and inspiring metaphor for modern Organizational Behavior. Wolves are dedicated team players, great communicators, and adaptable. These are key success attributes in today\u2019s workplace. Organizational Behavior uses these fundamentals to explore and explain the forces behind conventional corporate behavior and organizational theory.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2007", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=Q7RZAAAAYAAJ&dq=isbn:0073128929&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Organizational Behavior", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Organizational_Behavior.html?hl=&id=Q7RZAAAAYAAJ", "pageCount": 614, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0073128929", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780073128924", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Q7RZAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Q7RZAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Robert Kreitner", "Angelo Kinicki"], "ratingsCount": 1, "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=Q7RZAAAAYAAJ&dq=isbn:0073128929&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "averageRating": 4.0}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "These are key success attributes in today\u2019s workplace.
