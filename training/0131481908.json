A thorough and comprehensive textbook dealing with machine design that emphasizes both failure theory and analysis as well as emphasizing the synthesis and design aspects of machine elements. The book points out the commonality of the analytical approaches needed to design a wide variety of elements and emphasizes the use of computer-aided engineering as an approach to the design and analysis of these classes of problems. The text has been made independent of any software package Updated TKSOLVER models of all examples and case studies are included in the CD-ROM Updated MathCAD models of all examples and case studies are included in the CD-ROM All examples and case studies have been redone, and some expanded to make their presentations more detailed The numbers of problems has been increased by roughly 25 per cent Some sections of the text have included augmented figures, discussion or explanation", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2006", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=LNseAQAAIAAJ&dq=isbn:0131481908&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Machine Design", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 984, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "1.1.1.0.preview.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "STANFORD:36105114588499", "type": "OTHER"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LNseAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LNseAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Robert L.
