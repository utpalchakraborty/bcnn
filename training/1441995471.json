These circuits are used in current and emerging communication, computing, multimedia and biomedical products and microchips. The design methodologies presented will result in enhancing the yield (percentage of working chips in a high volume run) of RF and mmWave ICs which will enable successful manufacturing of such microchips in high volume.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2011-09-25", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=YEyZkQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1441995471&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Built-in-Self-Test and Digital Self-Calibration for RF SoCs", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 89, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "1441995471", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9781441995476", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YEyZkQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YEyZkQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Sleiman Bou-Sleiman", "Mohammed Ismail"], "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=YEyZkQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1441995471&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Built_in_Self_Test_and_Digital_Self_Cali.html?hl=&id=YEyZkQEACAAJ"}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This book will introduce design methodologies, known as Built-in-Self-Test (BiST) and Built-in-Self-Calibration (BiSC), which enhance the robustness of radio frequency (RF) and millimeter wave (mmWave) integrated circuits (ICs)."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "+Rj9KtBDdQI", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=YEyZkQEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "US", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "YEyZkQEACAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/YEyZkQEACAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}
