In this way, students learn to place themselves in the role of decision-maker and envision how they might respond to problems and situations that will arise in their future careers. This Fifth Edition boasts expanded coverage of valuation concepts, more quantitative material, and a streamlined, finance-focused presentation. A careful examination of conflicts of interest, a concentration on the impact of new technologies, new data, and refreshing examples all serve to enhance and illuminate important concepts.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2006", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=T-GZAAAAIAAJ&dq=isbn:0321280296&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Financial Markets and Institutions", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Financial_Markets_and_Institutions.html?hl=&id=T-GZAAAAIAAJ", "pageCount": 710, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "STANFORD:36105120249235", "type": "OTHER"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T-GZAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T-GZAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Frederic S.
