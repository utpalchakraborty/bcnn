The subject of this book has arisen as a result of research collaboration on device modelling with members of the School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering. I wanted to write a book which would be of practical help to those wishing to learn more about the mathematical and numerical methods involved in heteroju- tion device modelling. I have introduced only a comparatively small number of t- ics, and the reader may think that other important topics should have been included. But of the topics which I have introduced, I hope that I have given the reader some practical advice concerning the implementation of the methods which are discussed. This practical advice includes demonstrating how the implementation of the me- ods may be tailored to the speci?c device being modelled, and also includes some sections of computer code to illustrate this implementation. I have also included some background theory regarding the origins of the routines.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2009-12-14", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=oAHAjwEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1848829361&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Mathematical and Numerical Modelling of Heterostructure Semiconductor Devices: From Theory to Programming", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 406, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "1848829361", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9781848829367", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oAHAjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oAHAjwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["E.A.B.
