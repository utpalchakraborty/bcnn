{"totalItems": 1, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "volumeInfo": {"publisher": "Cengage Learning", "description": "Bestselling statistics author, Fredrick J. Gravetter, and co-author Lori-Ann B. Forzano have written a text for research methods that helps students see how interesting and exciting experimental and non-experimental research can be. Inviting and conversational, RESEARCH METHODS FOR THE BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES, Fourth Edition, leads students through the research process from start to finish. The text opens with tips and strategies for generating research ideas, moves to selecting measures and participants, and then offers an examination of research strategy and design. This step-by-step approach emphasizes the decisions researchers must make at each stage of the process. The authors avoid a cookbook approach to the facts by linking terminology with applied concepts; their lecture in a book style makes the text accessible to students by emphasizing discussion and explanation of topics. Each chapter ends with a set of student exercises and activities. Examples and content throughout the book reflect the most current APA guidelines.
