Like previous editions, this revision is written from the viewpoint of the applied mathematician, focusing both on the theory and the practical applications of Differential Equations as they apply to engineering and the sciences. A perennial best seller designed for engineers and scientists who need to use Elementary Differential Equations in their work and studies. The CD-ROM includes: The award-winning ODE Architect software. The software's 14 modules enable you to build and solve your own ODEs, and to use simulations and multimedia to develop detailed mathematical models and concepts in a truly interactive environment. The ODE Architect Companion. The Companion extends the ideas featured in each multimedia module. The web-based learning tools include: Review & Study Guidelines. The Chapter Review Guidelines will help you prepare for quizzes and exams. Online Review Quizzes. The quizzes enable you to test your knowledge of key concepts and provide diagnostic feedback that references appropriate sections in the text. PowerPoint Slides. You can print these slides out for in-class note taking. Getting Started with ODE Architect. This guide will help you get up-and-running with ODE Architect's simulations and multimedia.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2004-04-13", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=iQwXAQAAMAAJ&dq=isbn:047143339X&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Elementary differential equations", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 622, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "047143339X", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780471433392", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iQwXAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iQwXAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["William E.
