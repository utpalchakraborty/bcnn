Using Young & Freedman's research-based ISEE (Identify, Set up, Execute, Evaluate) problem-solving strategy, students develop the physical intuition and problem-solving skills required to tackle the text's extensive high-quality problem sets that have been developed and refined over the past five decades. The completely redesigned, pedagogically consistent artwork and diagrams integrate seamlessly with the text to help students better visualize key concepts. The cornerstone of the media package, MasteringPhysics, provides a library of conceptual tutorials and rigorous multi-step problems that deliver immediate and individualized guidance to each student based on their wrong answers and difficulties and also powers a superior gradebook and student skill-diagnostics profiler. The result is a single, effective solution for assigning uncompromising quality online homework, giving each and every student help where and when they need it, and evaluating students on both an individual and class level.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2003-07", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=42HmmgEACAAJ&dq=isbn:080538684X&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api", "title": "University Physics with Modern Physics with Mastering Physics", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/University_Physics_with_Modern_Physics_w.html?hl=&id=42HmmgEACAAJ", "pageCount": 1550, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "080538684X", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780805386844", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=42HmmgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=42HmmgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Hugh D.
