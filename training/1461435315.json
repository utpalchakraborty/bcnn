End-of-chapter exercises allow the reader to practice the fundamental concepts behind airbreathing propulsion, and the included PAGIC computer code will help the reader to examine the relationships between the performance parameters of different engines. Large amounts of data have on many different piston, turbojet, and turboprop engines have been compiled for this book and are included as an appendix.
