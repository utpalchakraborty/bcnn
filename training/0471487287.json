Now in a new Eighth Edition, this highly-accessible book has been fine-tuned and revised, making it more effective and even easier to use. It covers such topics as resistive circuits, nodal and loop analysis techniques, capacitance and inductance, AC steady-state analysis, polyphase circuits, the Laplace transform, two-port networks, and much more. For over twenty years, Irwin has provided readers with a straightforward examination of the basics of circuit analysis, including: Using real-world examples to demonstrate the usefulness of the material. Integrating MATLAB throughout the book and includes special icons to identify sections where CAD tools are used and discussed. Offering expanded and redesigned Problem-Solving Strategies sections to improve clarity. A new chapter on Op-Amps that gives readers a deeper explanation of theory. A revised pedagogical structure to enhance learning.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2005", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=-_AeAQAAIAAJ&dq=isbn:0471487287&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Basic engineering circuit analysis", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 794, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0471487287", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780471487289", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-_AeAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-_AeAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["J.
