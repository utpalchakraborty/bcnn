{"totalItems": 2, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "volumeInfo": {"publisher": "Delmar Pub", "description": "Introduction to Health Care is a college level introductory book for learners entering health care programs or for those that think they may be interested in a career in health care. The content covers a wide variety of topics that are shared by all health care professions. Twenty six chapters are organized into the following nine units: health care today, language of health care, human body, personal and workplace safety, behaviors for success, communication, health care skills, business of caring, and securing and maintaining employment. A key feature of this book is its emphasis on teaching learners to develop thinking skills as opposed to simply learning sets of facts. A problem solving model is introduced in Chapter 1 that includes how to assess a situation, consider alternatives, choose an appropriate alternative, evaluate the results, and revise as needed. How to think on the job is continually incorporated into the text. To further reinforce, a recurring element is included called Thinking It Through in which learners must problem-solve workplace examples using the principles found in each chapter. A thinking application problem has been added at the end of each chapter.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2006-07-31", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=stBXAAAAYAAJ&dq=isbn:1401860265&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Introduction to Health Care", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Introduction_to_Health_Care.html?hl=&id=stBXAAAAYAAJ", "pageCount": 561, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "0.1.1.0.preview.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "PSU:000062935708", "type": "OTHER"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=stBXAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=stBXAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Joyce Mitchell", "Lee Haroun"], "ratingsCount": 1, "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=stBXAAAAYAAJ&dq=isbn:1401860265&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Medical"], "averageRating": 5.0}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "A key feature of this book is its emphasis on teaching learners to develop thinking skills as opposed to simply learning sets of facts."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "nbRn52VLudg", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=stBXAAAAYAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "US", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "stBXAAAAYAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/stBXAAAAYAAJ"}, {"kind": "books#volume", "volumeInfo": {"publisher": "Cengage Learning", "description": "New edition of one of the most used texts in medical terminology.
