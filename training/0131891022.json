Message: Literature and the Writing Process promotes interactive learning by integrating writing instruction with the study of literature. Its approach utilizes writing as a mode of learning, as a means for promoting critical thinking, as a method for exploring and developing insights and ideas about literary works. The process-oriented instruction shows students how to use writing as a way of studying literature and gives them the tools to analyze literature on their own. This book allows instructors to teach writing and literature together in a single course. The complementary processes of reading and writing work together to improve students' compositional skills and increase their comprehension of imaginative literature. Story: This textbook grew out of the authors' long-standing interest in integrating the study of literature with the practice of composition. Many of their students have learned to write perceptively and well using literature as their subject matter. Great literature is always thought-provoking, always new. Why not utilize it to sharpen critical thinking and improving writing skills? Toward that end, we have combined an introduction to literature anthology with detailed instruction in the writing process.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2005", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=rIsEAAAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0131891022&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Literature and the Writing Process", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 1126, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0131891022", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780131891029", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rIsEAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rIsEAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Elizabeth McMahan", "Susan Day", "Robert Funk"], "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=rIsEAAAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0131891022&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Language Arts & Disciplines"], "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Literature_and_the_Writing_Process.html?hl=&id=rIsEAAAACAAJ"}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "&quot;New to this edition: &quot; New photographs and images chosen to enhance understanding and appreciation of literature Expanded, updated discussion of researched writing (Chapter 17) Further instruction on the elements of argument and arguing an ..."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "ljBILEyPd1k", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=rIsEAAAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "US", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "rIsEAAAACAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/rIsEAAAACAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}
