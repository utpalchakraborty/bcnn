{"totalItems": 1, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "volumeInfo": {"description": "Business Economics builds on the authority, clarity and real-world relevance of Economics by Gregory Mankiw and Mark Taylor (two of the world\u2019s leading economists) to create an introductory economics textbook fully focused on the curriculum and pedagogical needs of business economics students. Business Economics has a superb logical structure. The classic ten principles approach to economics is retained and right at the outset the text considers the business environment so immediately establishing the book\u2019s business focus. Both microeconomics and macroeconomics are then comprehensively covered and each perspective is carefully mined for insights directly relevant to business economics students. A final part examines the implications of economic globalization for the conduct of business internationally.Business Economics is a global textbook with a particular focus on Europe, the Middle East and Africa; it is replete with examples from all these regions.This text is ideal for use on both business economics degrees and on business economics modules on business, engineering and social science courses at undergraduate level. It is also ideal for use on MBA courses.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2013", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=s5ySMQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1408069814&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Business Economics", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 640, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "1408069814", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9781408069813", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=s5ySMQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=s5ySMQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Mark P.
