This heavily reviewed, new text presents information in the form of bulleted lists and tables; with minimal use of text paragraphs. The author saw a great need for stepped out worked examples; incorporated biological, medicinal, and environmental applications; and an art program that has yet to be seen in organic chemistry! A highlight of the art program are the micro-to-macro art pieces helping students to conceptually understand organic chemistry.
