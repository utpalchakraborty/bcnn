{"totalItems": 1, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "volumeInfo": {"publisher": "Academic Press", "description": "Motor control is a relatively young field of research exploring how the nervous system produces purposeful, coordinated movements in its interaction with the body and the environment through conscious and unsconscious thought. Many books purporting to cover motor control have veered off course to examine biomechanics and physiology rather than actual control, leaving a gap in the literature. This book covers all the major perspectives in motor control, with a balanced approach. There are chapters explicitly dedicated to control theory, to dynamical systems, to biomechanics, to different behaviors, and to motor learning, including case studies. Reviews current research in motor control Contains balanced perspectives among neuroscience, psychology, physics and biomechanics Highlights controversies in the field Discusses neurophysiology, control theory, biomechanics, and dynamical systems under one cover Links principles of motor control to everyday behaviors Includes case studies delving into topics in more detail", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2012", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": true}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=pCOD-qYsGewC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0124159567&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Fundamentals of Motor Control", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 352, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "9780124159563", "type": "ISBN_13"}, {"identifier": "0124159567", "type": "ISBN_10"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pCOD-qYsGewC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pCOD-qYsGewC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Mark L.
