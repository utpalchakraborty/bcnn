{"totalItems": 1, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "volumeInfo": {"publisher": "American Mathematical Soc.", "description": "The theory of nonlinear elliptic equations is currently one of the most actively developing branches of the theory of partial differential equations. This book investigates boundary value problems for nonlinear elliptic equations of arbitrary order. In addition to monotone operator methods, a broad range of applications of topological methods to nonlinear differential equations is presented: solvability, estimation of the number of solutions, and the branching of solutions of nonlinear equations. Skrypnik establishes, by various procedures, a priori estimates and the regularity of solutions of nonlinear elliptic equations of arbitrary order. Also covered are methods of homogenization of nonlinear elliptic problems in perforated domains. The book is suitable for use in graduate courses in differential equations and nonlinear functional analysis.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "1994-01-01", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=4W9JAQAAIAAJ&dq=isbn:0821846167&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Methods for Analysis of Nonlinear Elliptic Boundary Value Problems", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 348, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "0.11.1.0.preview.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0821846167", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780821846162", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "authors": ["I.
