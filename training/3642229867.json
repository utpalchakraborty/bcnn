Mobile terminals feature an ever increasing number of wireless communication alternatives including GPS, Bluetooth, GSM, 3G, WiFi or DVB-H. Considering that the total power available for each terminal is limited by the relatively slow increase in battery performance expected in the near future, the need for efficient circuits is now critical. This book presents the basic techniques available to design low power RF CMOS analogue circuits. It gives circuit designers a complete guide of alternatives to optimize power consumption and explains the application of these rules in the most common RF building blocks: LNA, mixers and PLLs. It is set out using practical examples and offers a unique perspective as it targets designers working within the standard CMOS process and all the limitations inherent in these technologies.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2011-09-15", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=B6L2kQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:3642229867&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Low Power RF Circuit Design in Standard CMOS Technology", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 236, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "3642229867", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9783642229862", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B6L2kQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B6L2kQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Unai Alvarado", "Guillermo Bistu\u00e9", "I\u00f1igo Ad\u00edn"], "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=B6L2kQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:3642229867&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Technology & Engineering"], "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Low_Power_RF_Circuit_Design_in_Standard.html?hl=&id=B6L2kQEACAAJ"}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This book presents the basic techniques available to design low power RF CMOS analogue circuits."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "J1ObRFA8jkg", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=B6L2kQEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "US", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "B6L2kQEACAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/B6L2kQEACAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}
