This practical guide that covers all of the need to know topics in a very systematic way. For each machine learning approach, each step in the process is detailed, from preparing the data for analysis to evaluating the results. These steps will build the knowledge you need to apply them to your own data science tasks.Intended for those who want to learn how to use R's machine learning capabilities and gain insight from your data. Perhaps you already know a bit about machine learning, but have never used R; or perhaps you know a little R but are new to machine learning. In either case, this book will get you up and running quickly. It would be helpful to have a bit of familiarity with basic programming concepts, but no prior experience is required.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2013-07", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=nEfxnQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1782162143&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Machine Learning with R", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Machine_Learning_with_R.html?hl=&id=nEfxnQEACAAJ", "pageCount": 396, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "1782162143", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9781782162148", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nEfxnQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nEfxnQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Brett Lantz"], "ratingsCount": 5, "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=nEfxnQEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1782162143&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Computers"], "averageRating": 4.0}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "Perhaps you already know a bit about machine learning, but have never used R; or perhaps you know a little R but are new to machine learning.
