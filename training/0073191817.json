The book begins by acquainting students with the meaning of personality and providing them with a solid foundation for understanding the nature of theory, as well as its crucial contributions to science. The chapters that follow present twenty-three major theories: coverage of each theory also encompasses a biographical sketch of each theorist, related research, and applications to real life. The new edition includes greater coverage of the Big Five theory, a new organization, and updated research throughout.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2005-03-04", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=IYLsAAAAMAAJ&dq=isbn:0073191817&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Theories of personality", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Theories_of_personality.html?hl=&id=IYLsAAAAMAAJ", "pageCount": 563, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0073191817", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780073191812", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IYLsAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IYLsAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Gregory J.
