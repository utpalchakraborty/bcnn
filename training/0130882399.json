It text stresses the application of mathematics to problem solving rather than derivation of theory. It provides a balance between physical and chemical hydrogeology. Numerous case studies cultivate reader understanding of the occurrence and movement of ground water in a variety of geologic settings. This valuable reference includes five new case histories: The Dakota Aquifer, Fractures Sedimentary Rocks\u2014Newark basin, Faults as Aquifer Boundaries, Desert Hydrology\u2014Azraq basin, Jordan. Uses the Internet to obtain hydrogeologic data and information. Includes well-developed case studies in most of the chapters. Contains tables covering various functions, unit conversions, and additional data for solving well hydraulics, water chemistry, and contaminant transport problems. For readers interested in advanced hydrology, groundwater hydrology, hydrogeology, and civil engineering.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2001", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=1kS9QgAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0130882399&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Applied Hydrogeology", "printType": "BOOK", "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Applied_Hydrogeology.html?hl=&id=1kS9QgAACAAJ", "pageCount": 598, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0130882399", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780130882394", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1kS9QgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1kS9QgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Charles Willard Fetter"], "ratingsCount": 3, "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=1kS9QgAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0130882399&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Science"], "averageRating": 3.0}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This book looks at hydrogeology."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "beuXT5EaOlc", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=1kS9QgAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "US", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "1kS9QgAACAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/1kS9QgAACAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}
