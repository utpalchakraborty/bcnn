Considers its diverse range of applications and provides readers with probabilistic intuition and insight in thinking about problems. This revised edition contains additional material on compound Poisson random variables including an identity which can be used to efficiently compute moments; a new chapter on Poisson approximations; and coverage of the mean time spent in transient states as well as examples relating to the Gibb's sampler, the Metropolis algorithm and mean cover time in star graphs.
