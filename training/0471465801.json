This text is ideal for sophomore/junior-level courses in cell biology offered out of biology or molecular and cell biology departments. Cell and Molecular Biology provides an alternative for faculty looking for a text that concentrates on core concepts without sacrificing coverage of experimental evidence. Karp explores core concepts in considerable depth, and presents experimental detail when it helps to explain and reinforce the concept being explained. This edition also continues to offer an exceedingly clear presentation and excellent art program, both of which have received high praise in prior editions.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2004-07-07", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=NsxrQgAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0471465801&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 864, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0471465801", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780471465805", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NsxrQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NsxrQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Gerald Karp"], "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=NsxrQgAACAAJ&dq=isbn:0471465801&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Science"], "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Cell_and_Molecular_Biology.html?hl=&id=NsxrQgAACAAJ"}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This edition also continues to offer an exceedingly clear presentation and excellent art program, both of which have received high praise in prior editions."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "iqhHE0T3T9Q", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=NsxrQgAACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "US", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "NsxrQgAACAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/NsxrQgAACAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}
