Topics covered within are representative of the field\u2019s wide scope, including KAM and normal form theories, perturbation and variational methods, integrable systems, stability of nonlinear solutions as well as applications to cosmology, fluid mechanics and water waves. The volume contains both surveys and original research papers and gives a concise overview of the above topics, with results ranging from mathematical modeling to rigorous analysis and numerical simulation. It will be of particular interest to graduate students as well as researchers in mathematics and physics, who wish to learn more about the powerful and elegant analytical techniques for Hamiltonian partial differential equations.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2015-09-14", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=L5dergEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1493929496&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Hamiltonian Partial Differential Equations and Applications", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 424, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "1493929496", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9781493929498", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=L5dergEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=L5dergEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Philippe Guyenne", "David Nicholls", "Catherine Sulem"], "allowAnonLogging": false, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=L5dergEACAAJ&dq=isbn:1493929496&hl=&source=gbs_api", "categories": ["Mathematics"], "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.com/books/about/Hamiltonian_Partial_Differential_Equatio.html?hl=&id=L5dergEACAAJ"}, "searchInfo": {"textSnippet": "This book is a unique selection of work by world-class experts exploring the latest developments in Hamiltonian partial differential equations and their applications."}, "saleInfo": {"country": "US", "saleability": "NOT_FOR_SALE", "isEbook": false}, "etag": "YtOQv9NL1bM", "accessInfo": {"webReaderLink": "http://books.google.com/books/reader?id=L5dergEACAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api", "publicDomain": false, "embeddable": false, "country": "US", "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED", "pdf": {"isAvailable": false}, "quoteSharingAllowed": false, "viewability": "NO_PAGES", "epub": {"isAvailable": false}, "accessViewStatus": "NONE"}, "id": "L5dergEACAAJ", "selfLink": "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/L5dergEACAAJ"}], "kind": "books#volumes"}
