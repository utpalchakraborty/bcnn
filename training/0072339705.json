Slowly, the course has moved toward a consumer orientation, providing students with a broad, descriptive survey of the insurance field, covering topics such as legal aspects, life and health, and property and liability. Over the past 10 years, textbooks began to promote, and to a limited degree, incorporate a stronger business risk management component while maintaining a consumer orientation.
