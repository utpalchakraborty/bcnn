{"totalItems": 1, "items": [{"kind": "books#volume", "volumeInfo": {"publisher": "Wiley", "description": "This book provides an introduction to numerical analysis and is intended to be used by undergraduates in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering. The main prerequisite is a one-year course in the calculus of functions of one variable, but some familiarity with computers is also needed. With this background, the book can be used for a sophomore-level course in numerical analysis. The last four chapters of the book present numerical methods for linear algebra, ordinary differential equations, and practical differential equations. A background in these subjects would be helpful, but these chapters include the necessary introduction to the theory of these subjects.-Pref.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2004", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=2CQnAQAAIAAJ&dq=isbn:0471433373&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Elementary numerical analysis", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 560, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "UCSC:32106017222198", "type": "OTHER"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2CQnAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2CQnAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Kendall E.
