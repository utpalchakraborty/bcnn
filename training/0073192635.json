Its approach is classic and practical and emphasizes role-plays. FUNDAMENTALS, written by a salesperson turned teacher, draws widely from Charles Futrell\u2019s experience as a sales professional rather than from a staid theoretical perspective. The text is filled with practical tips and business-examples gleaned from years of experience in sales with Colgate, Upjohn, and Ayerst and from the author\u2019s sales consulting business. Charles Futrell focuses on improving communication skills and emphasizes that no matter what career a student pursues; selling skills are a valuable asset.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2005-01-01", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=cQb3lVayVJ8C&dq=isbn:0073192635&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Fundamentals of Selling", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 658, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "0.0.1.0.preview.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "0073192635", "type": "ISBN_10"}, {"identifier": "9780073192635", "type": "ISBN_13"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cQb3lVayVJ8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cQb3lVayVJ8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["Charles M.
