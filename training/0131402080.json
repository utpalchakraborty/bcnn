McMurry/Fay's Chemistry focuses on visualizing and thinking to achieve try understanding. The text teaches the basics of solving problems using its trademark clear discussions and new art-enhanced format. The text moves students beyond rote quantitative problem solving, encouraging them to visualize and think about a problem before beginning to solve it; it conveys the key concepts being discussed to help students truly understand the chemistry by using unique, proven features. The clean, interesting writing style talks directly to students with a minimum of distractions. Molecular illustrations are abundant and are placed where they are referenced for maximum effectiveness with students. The well-integrated McMurry/Fay media program includes the IRCD, PH GradeAssist, a CW/CD suite and more.", "language": "en", "publishedDate": "2004", "readingModes": {"text": false, "image": false}, "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=qFYvAQAAIAAJ&dq=isbn:0131402080&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api", "title": "Chemistry", "printType": "BOOK", "pageCount": 1216, "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE", "contentVersion": "0.1.1.0.preview.0", "industryIdentifiers": [{"identifier": "STANFORD:36105114379147", "type": "OTHER"}], "imageLinks": {"smallThumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qFYvAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api", "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qFYvAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}, "authors": ["John McMurry", "Robert C.
